# MyFileTransferProtocol

This is a client/server application that allows file transfer between clients and the server. 
The server provides clients with a minimum number of commands for authentication, operating with directories and files. 
Additionally, there is an authorization mechanism (whitelist/blacklist) for user accounts and a mechanism for securely transmitting the password during authentication.
